# Age Group Swimmer of the Year project

This project supports the generation of the AGSOTY (Age Group Swimmer of the Year) page used by PAC (Pacific Masters - an LMSC of United States Masters Swimming.)   This page is used by PacMasters to record all PAC and USMS top ten places, PAC and USMS records, and OW top 10 results, awarding points to swimmers based on their results in their gender and age group.  Visit [the PacMasters Web Site](http://pacificmasters.org/) to learn more about Pacific Masters swimming.  To see current and past swimmer of the year pages visit [this page](https://pacificmasters.org/content/laura-val-swimmer-year-awards).

Not only does this project generate the AGSOTY page, but it is also used by Pacific Masters to acknowledge the top male and female swimmers for each age group at the annual Pacific Masters SCY Championships.  At the same time the overall top male and female swimmers receive the Laura Val Swimmer of the Year award.

This project requires Perl, MySQL, and a few perl modules (available on CPAN.)  It is designed to be downloaded and run on a personal computer and also run as a turnkey system running on a web server.  Specifically, this code currently runs on a MacBook Pro and also the PacMasters Linux-based web server.
