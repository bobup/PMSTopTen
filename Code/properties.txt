# RSIND file name pattern - the regexp pattern to recognize the RSIND file to be used by this program.
# The RSIND file name pattern will match the simple file name, and is assumed to be relative 
# to <appRootDir>/SourceData/PMSSwimmerData
# If this needs to be overridden for some reason it should be done in the year-specific property file.
# The RSIND file name pattern may allow a few different spellings for the file, but the substring "RSIND"
# is the preferred substring match.
RSIDNFileNamePattern		^(.*RSIND.*)|(.*RSIDN.*)$

# Merged Member data file name pattern - the regexp pattern to recognize the merged member file to be used by this program.  
# Relative to SourceData/PMSSwimmerData
# If this needs to be overridden for some reason it should be done in the year-specific property file.
MergedMemberFileNamePattern		^.*MergedMembers.*$

# PMS Club info file name pattern - the regexp pattern to recognize the club info file to be used by this program.  
# Relative to SourceData/PMSSwimmerData
# If this needs to be overridden for some reason it should be done in the year-specific property file.
ClubFileNamePattern		^.*[cC][lL][uU][bB].*$
