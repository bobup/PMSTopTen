<h1 style="text-align:center">Proposal:  Eliminate Split Age Groups</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Bob Upshaw</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center">August 12, 2017</h2>
<p>
This proposal was first introduced to the board on June 21st, 2017.
<p>
<h2>Split Age Groups</h2>
<p>
When computing points for Age Group Swimmer of the Year (AGSOTY) we use the points every swimmer earns during the AGSOTY season.
An AGSOTY season begins on June 1st and ends on December 31st of the following year.  For example, the 2017 AGSOTY season began
with the Short Course Yards season (June 1, 2016) and ends at the end of the Short Course Meters season (December 31, 2017.)
When computing Age Group Swimmer of the Year (AGSOTY) some swimmers will change age groups in the middle of the
AGSOTY season.  In fact, every year approximately one-fifth of PAC swimmers change age groups.  
That means that every PAC swimmer
will change age groups during 1 out of every 5 AGSOTY seasons.  
When a swimmer occupies 2 age groups during a single AGSOTY season this is known as a "split age group".
When a swimmer is part of a split age group they will have their points split across their two age groups.  
Obviously this places them at a  disadvantage when
competing for AGSOTY and Swimmer of the Year (SOTY).  For this reason I would like to make the following proposal:
<p>
I’d like to propose that, for the purposes of computing everyone’s placement in the new Age Group Standings, that we declare 
everyone’s Age Determining Date to be December 31st of the AGSOTY season year.  The basic reason is that every year approximately 
one-fifth of our swimmers have their Age Group Standings points split across two age groups, making it difficult for them to 
compete with others in their age group.  This affects every one of us every 5 years.  For example:  consider PAC member 
Anna Senko:  Her birthdate was May 4, 1992.  For the 2017 AGSOTY season she's in the 18-24 age group up until May 3rd of 2017, 
after which time she's in the 25-29 age group.  She has already scored points in both age groups.  However, if we considered 
her age for the entire 2017 season to be her age on December 31, 2017 then she'd be in the 25-29 age group for the entire 
2017 season.  Thus all of her points would be applied to that one age group.
<p>
Here are some points to think about:
<ol>
	<li>Consider SCY, SCM, LCM, and OW.  Of those, all but SCY consider the age of the swimmer their age 
	on December 31 of the year of the swim.  So this proposal does not introduce anything unfamiliar.</li>
	<li>As of August 12, 2017 we have 1,767 swimmers who have competed in AGSOTY point-earning events.  Of those,
		1,548 have earned points.  Of those, 94 have split age groups.  For details on every swimmer in a 
		split age group, and how it affects them, see <a href="cag.html"target="_blank">Split Age Groups</a>.
		(This Split Age Groups page is described further below.)</li>
	<li>Laura Val is a counter-example:  she won both of her age groups in 2016!  I don't begrudge her that amazing
	accomplishment, but why make it possible?  One age group a year is enough, isn't it...?</li>
	<li>Note:
		<ul>
			<li>Swimmers still compete against their own age group in pool and OW events.  Their place (thus their points earned for 
			a swim) are still based on their age group at the time of the swim:
			<ul>
				<li>For LCM and SCM and OW their age groups are based on their age at the end of the year of the swim.</li>
				<li>For SCY their age groups are based on their age on the last day of the meet.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Prior to 2017 OW swimmers who "aged up" during the OW season had the points they earned in their younger age
			group added to their points earned in their older age group.  Since an OW season is less than a single calendar year
			(and does not straddle a calendar year) this is effectively the same thing as what is proposed here EXCEPT it differs
			slightly if the swimmer does not swim an OW event after they age up.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Issue:  Consider the swimmer who competes in the 55-59 age group 100y back and is ranked 2nd in Pacific Masters.  
	He gets 9 points.  He then ages up and
	swims the 100y back in the 60-64 age group, is ranked 1st in Pacific Masters, and gets 11 points.  If we blindly combine his points for his two age
	groups then we'll give him 9+11 points = 20 points for the 100y back.  This is more points than a "non-aging up"
	swimmer can earn for the 100y back.  This unfairly gives him an advantage over other swimmers every 5 years.
	Solution:
		<ul>
			<li>Remove points earned for duplicate events in the two age groups.  Always remove the lesser points (likely those earned
			in the younger age group since competition there is more difficult.)  So, in this case, he gets 11 points for the
			100 y back for this AGSOTY season.</li>
			<li>Do the same for national top 10 rankings.</li>
			<li>Do the same for PAC and national records.</li>
		</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Details Using Real Data</h2>
<p>To help visualize the effects of this proposal let's look at  AGSOTY  with and without split age groups.
Historically we've always used split age groups, and we are continuing that tradition for 2017.  Here are the AGSOTY Standings
as they exist today:
<blockquote>
	<a href="index.html" target="_blank">2017 AGSOTY using split age groups</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, here is what 2017 AGSOTY would look like if we combined the split age groups following the proposal above:
<blockquote>
	<a href="index_cag.html" target="_blank">2017 AGSOTY combining split age groups</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I used Anna as an example above, take a look at her standings in both the 
<a href="index.html" target="_blank">2017 AGSOTY using split age groups</a> and the
<a href="index_cag.html" target="_blank">2017 AGSOTY combining split age groups</a> (search for "Senko" on both pages.)
You'll see that with split age groups she is found twice, but when combining age groups she appears only once.
Note also that this doesn't just affect her; other swimmers move up or down depending on how she places when combining
her points in her two age groups.

<p>If you want to look at other people who are in split age groups during the 2017 AGSOTY season the I've produced a list
of all of those swimmers here:
<blockquote>
	<a href="cag.html" target="_blank">Swimmers with split age groups in AGSOTY 2017</a>
</blockquote>

<p>This page is fairly dense, as it was generated in order to allow us to look at very specific situations.  But if nothing else 
pay attention to the row coloring; most are <span style="background:#33ff40">green</span>, which show those swimmers 
who BENIFIT from combining their split age groups.  
Some are <span style="background:#33d7ff">blue</span>, which show those swimmers who place the same in their combined age 
group as they did in one of their split age groups.
This is rare, but it happens.  Lastly, the <span style="background:#fffe33">yellow</span> rows show those 
who (at the time of this writing - the 2017 AGSOTY season is not over yet) 
place lower in their combined age group than they did in one of their split age groups.  Note that the 
<span style="background:#ff7b33">orange</span> columns show you
every swimmer's place in both their split age groups and their combined age group.

<p>For those of you who might want to manipulate the data we also have the AGSOTY standings generated as spreadsheets.
These spreadsheets are used at the end of the AGSOTY season to help with the publication of the female and male Swimmer of the Year,
and also the top 10 and top 3 age group swimmers of the year for each gender and age group.
First, the spreadsheets as they look now for split age groups:
<blockquote>
	<a href="Top10ExcelResults.xlsx" target="_blank">Top10ExcelResults.xlsx 2017 split age groups</a>
	<br>
	<a href="Top_3_ExcelResults.xlsx" target="_blank">Top_3_ExcelResults.xlsx split age groups</a>
</blockquote>
Here are the same spreadsheets when combining the split age groups:
<blockquote>
	<a href="Top10ExcelResultscag.xlsx" target="_blank">Top10ExcelResultscag.xlsx combined age groups</a>
	<br>
	<a href="Top_3_ExcelResultscag.xlsx" target="_blank">Top_3_ExcelResultscag.xlsx combined age groups</a>
</blockquote>
