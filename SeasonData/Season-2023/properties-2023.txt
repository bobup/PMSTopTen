# ePostals (added 2021 as a test)
#	result file name relative to SourceData directory;			<-- NOTE semi-colon; colon won't work here.
#		ORG - usually USMS  @@@ 								<-- NOTE @@@ used as terminator for every value 
#		distance - a indication of the distance of the ePostal or 0 if the ePostal
#			is not a specific distance. For example, "3000" is the distance in the 
#			specified Units (below), "0" means there is no specific distance, in, for
#			example, the 1 hour swim. In ALL cases this value is an integer.
#		time - the time allotted to the ePostal, or 0 if there is no specific time allotted.
#			For example, "1:00:00.00" or "1 hour" is the time allotted to the 1 hour swim, but "0" would
#			be specified for the 5k ePostal since the time is whatever each competitor requires.
#			In ALL cases, if non-zero this value must contain at least one non digit (e.g. ":" or "h").
#		Units - the distance units for this ePostal. Yards or Meters is common.
#		
#	!!! NOTE: the combination of ("distance" or "time", whichever is non-zero), and "Units" 
#		must be unique across ePostals for a single gender.
#	!!! The combination is used to define a unique "Event"
#
#		Meet title  - Used as EventName for an Event in the database
#		Meet Link - (link to description-should be link to usms.org)@@@ 
#		Meet Begin Date - (yyyy-mm-dd)@@@
#		Meet End Date - (yyyy-mm-dd)@@@ 
#		Meet is sanctioned by PMS - (yes=1, no=0)
