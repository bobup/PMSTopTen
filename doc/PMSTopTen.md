### Overview
This document contains the details of how to support and run the PMSTopTen project to generate the AGSOTY (Age Group Swimmer Of The Year) page for Pacific Masters (or any other group that wants to do the same thing.)  

This project is comprised of 3 main Perl programs which are used to fetch and process swimmer results for a specific AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a>.  These results are "scraped" from two different web sites:  usms.org and pacificmasters.org.  Both of these web sites are used by their respective organizations to publish the individual swimming results of its members.  It is these results that we analyze to compute the top swimmers in our LMSC.  All swimmers who compete in USMS sanctioned (or approved) events and who earn points (see the AGSOTY rules [[[need link]]]) are included in this analysis and are part of the AGSOTY page.

Here is a high-level view of the data and control flow during the generation of an AGSOTY page.

![PMSTopten Flow](PMSTopTenProcess.jpg)

In order to generate an AGSOTY page you need to fetch the PMSTopTen project files, configure the property files, and then execute the contained programs. 

#### Documentation Conventions
This document will often list steps to perform in the form of Unix shell commands.  A shell command begins with a '%'.  Meta terms are surrounded by <>.  For example:  
% cd \<rootDir\>  
which means "change directory to the directory known as the 'rootDir'".

### Glossary
1. AGSOTY : Age Group Swimmer of the Year.  Recognition awarded to one male and one female Pacific Masters swimmer.  Recently renamed "LVSOTY" (Laura Val Swimmer of the Year) but since AGSOTY has been used for years and it shows up in the code we use these two terms interchangeably. 
3. LVSOTY : See "AGSOTY" above.
4. LVSOTY Committee : a group formed within Pacific Masters to choose the male and female Swimmer of the Year for every AGSOTY season.  The male and female recipients of this award are determined largely, but not solely, on the basis of their earned AGSOTY points.
5. AGSOTY files : the files generated by the PMSTopTen project.  The most important file is an HTML file ("index.html") 
1.  appRootDir : the root of the tree holding all the files in a local repository tree (e.g. the PMSTopTen project tree.)
2. rootDir : the parent directory of the appRootDir.
3. yearToProcess : the AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a> being processed by the PMSTopTen project.  "year" in the name is a misnomer, since a full AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a> encompasses 18 calendar months. See <a href="#seasons">"What is a Season?"</a> below.

### PMSTopTen Project Files
The code and support files for the PMSTopTen project are stored in a GitHub repository here:
[https://github.com/bobup/PMSTopTen](https://github.com/bobup/PMSTopTen)  
In addition, this project uses a shared library of Perl modules stored in this GitHub repository: 
[https://github.com/bobup/PMSPerlModules](https://github.com/bobup/PMSPerlModules)  
General purposes Perl modules are used and are available from CPAN.


To build and use the PMSTopTen project you'll need to create TWO local repositories:  one for PMSTopTen and the other for PMSPerlModules.  Details follow:
##### PMSPerlModules
To create the PMSPerlModules local repository execute the following commands:  
1. `% cd <rootDir>`  
2. `% git clone https://github.com/bobup/PMSPerlModules`

##### Files that make up PMSPerlModules
When you create the local repository for the PMSPerlModules project you'll have a tree with the root being named 'PMSPerlModules' located in your "rootDir".  This is known as the "appRootDir" in the documentation.  Here is what makes up the appRootDir of the PMSPerlModules project when cloned from the GitHub repository:

PMSPerlModules/

* History_MySqlSupport.pm - (Not used by PMSTopTen.  Used by PMSOWPoints only.)
* PMSConstants.pm - Contains some global constants.
* PMSLogging.pm  - Supports logging to files and the console.
* PMSMacros.pm - Macro support for template processing and code.
* PMSProcess2SingleFile.pm - (Not used by PMSTopTen.  Used by PMSOWPoints only.)
* PMSStoreSingleRow.pm - (Not used by PMSTopTen.  Used by PMSOWPoints only.)
* PMSStruct.pm - Contains more complex data structures.
* PMSUtil.pm - Generally purpose utility routines.
* PMS_ImportPMSData.pm - Read various support data files (<a href="rsidn">RSIDN</a>, etc.)
* PMS_MySqlSupport.pm  - MySql support routines.



##### PMSTopTen
To create the PMSTopTen local repository execute the following commands:  
1. `% cd <rootDir>`  
2. `% git clone https://github.com/bobup/PMSTopTen`

##### Files that make up PMSTopTen

When you create the local repository for the PMSTopTen project you'll have a tree with the root being named 'PMSTopTen' located in your "rootDir".  This is known as the "appRootDir" in the documentation.  Here is what makes up the appRootDir of the PMSTopTen project when cloned from the GitHub repository:

PMSTopTen/

* Code/  - Contains Perl code, HTML templates, bash scripts, etc.
 * GetResults.pl  - The program used to fetch the raw data processed by PMSTopTen in order to create the top ten html file (and other output.)
 * Topten2.pl  - The program used to analyze the data files fetched by GetResults.pl and generate the top ten html file (and other output.)

* doc/  - The directory holding this document and others.

### Configuration of the Local Repository
Once you've created the local repositories for the PMSPerlModules and the PMSTopTen projects you need to configure the PMSTopTen project.  Here is what needs to be done:

##### Make the <a href="#GeneratedFiles">GeneratedFiles</a> Directory
We need to make sure the directory into which all generated files are written exists:

1. `% cd <rootDir>/PMSTopTen`  
2. `% mkdir -p GeneratedFiles`

##### Configure the Database
Next you need to configure database access for the PMSTopTen project whose <appRootDir> is <rootDir>/PMSTopTen.  To do this you need to update a property file stored in <appRootDir>/Code named properties_DB.txt:

1. `% cd <appRootDir>/Code`
2. `% vi properties_DB.txt`
    3. Change the value of "dbHost" to be the host name of the server hosting the database server.  This will be "localhost" if the database server is running on the same server running this project.
    4. Set the value of "dbName" to the name of the name database being used by this project.
    5. Set the value of "dbUser" to the name of the database user used by this project.
    6. Set the value of "dbPass" to the to the dbUser's password that gives the user read/write access to all the tables of the dbName database.  Since this should be kept private DO NOT allow this file to be readable to world.  If necessary do this: 
4. `% chmod go-rwx properties_DB.txt`

##### PERL CPAN Libraries
The PMSTopTen project depends on a few public domain Perl libraries in order to support Excel reading and writing.  These are the CPAN libraries that were used during development:

* Excel-Writer-XLSX-0.96/ - [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Excel-Writer-XLSX/lib/Excel/Writer/XLSX.pm](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Excel-Writer-XLSX/lib/Excel/Writer/XLSX.pm)
* Spreadsheet-Read-0.75/ - [http://search.cpan.org/~hmbrand/Spreadsheet-Read/Read.pm](http://search.cpan.org/~hmbrand/Spreadsheet-Read/Read.pm)
* Spreadsheet-XLSX-0.15/ - [http://search.cpan.org/~dmow/Spreadsheet-XLSX-0.13-withoutworldwriteables/lib/Spreadsheet/XLSX.pm](http://search.cpan.org/~dmow/Spreadsheet-XLSX-0.13-withoutworldwriteables/lib/Spreadsheet/XLSX.pm)

You must guarantee that the Perl search path includes these libraries that you've downloaded and installed on the machine running this project.  The easiest way to do this is to set the environment variable "PERL5LIB" to the list of directories holding the above libraries.  For example, add this statement to your login initialization file:

`% export PERL5LIB=/home/cpan/Excel-Writer-XLSX-0.96/lib\`
<br>
`    :/home/cpan/Spreadsheet-Read-0.75\`
<br>
`    :/home/cpan/Spreadsheet-XLSX-0.15/lib`

Note that later versions may be available and should probably work just as well as the versions above.

### Run the PMSTopTen Project
Once we have the GeneratedFiles/ subdirectory, we've configured our database access, and we have set up our Perl search path we can fetch race results, analyze them, and generate the AGSOTY page.  There are a number of ways to do this, but the easiest way is to do this:

1. `% cd <appRootDir>/Code/Scripts`
2. `% ./DoFetchAndProcessTopten <yearToProcess>`

The bash script "DoFetchAndProcessTopten" will fetch various results to process, and, if those results are different from the last time we fetched results, it will process the results and generate the AGSOTY page.

The "DoFetchAndProcessTopten" script performs a lot of steps, but basically executes two scripts.  Here is how you can execute those scripts by hand:

1. `% cd <appRootDir>/Code/Scripts`
2. `% ./FetchTopten <yearToProcess>`
3. `# assuming the above did not get any errors we can now generate our AGSOTY page`
4. `% ./GenTopten2 <yearToProcess>`

At this point the generated AGSOTY page, Excel files, and log files have been written to <appRootDir>/GeneratedFiles/Generated-\<yearToProcess\> . These are simply known as the "Generated Files".


<a name="GeneratedFiles"></a>
### Generated Files
The primary reason for the PMSTopTen project is to generate files representing various views of a specific AGSOTY season.  We make these files available to all PAC swimmers (well, actually, anyone can access them, but they are not very interesting unless you're a PAC competitor.)  Some files display the current standings as an HTML page, others display a subset of the standings for use by the LVSOTY Committee.  These files summarize all AGSOTY points earned by all (or a subset of) PAC competitive swimmers for a specific AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a>.



 For example, here are the files generated during the 2018 AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a>:

Generated-2018/

* index.html - The AGSOTY page.  Summarizes all points for all competitive PAC swimmers for the current <a href="#seasons">season</a>.
* HTMLVSupport-CAG/ - A directory holding more HTML results for each gender and age group.    <a href="#Vsupport">Details below</a>.
* TTStats.html - Statistics generated while generating the AGSOTY page.  <a href="#TTStats">Details below</a>
* cag.html - Special page describing the swimmers who change age groups during this AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a>.
* GetResultsLog-2018.txt - Log file generated by GetResults.pl.
* TopTenLog-2018.txt - Log file generated by Topten2.pl.
* TTStatsLog-2018.txt - Log file generated by TTStats.pl.
* FullExcelResults-2018.xlsx - The AGSOTY page as an Excel file.
* TopSOTYContenders-2018.xlsx - A report on AGSOTY swimmers who are the top AGSOTY swimmers for the <a href="#seasons">season</a>.
* Top_3_ExcelResults-2018.xlsx - A report on the AGSOTY swimmers who are placed top 3 in their gender and age group.
* index.html.old - the previous version of index.html.
* Historical/  - this is either a symbolic link to 

<a name="SourceData"></a>
### Historical/SourceData/
Each year covered in the Historical/ directory contains a SourceData/ subdirectory.  
(need to clean up the Historical tree) 

<a name="SourceData2018"></a>
##### SourceData-2018/
The SourceData-\<yearToProcess>/ directory is used to hold the USMS and PAC results which we process in order to compute every swimmer's AGSOTY points.  These results are stored as files which are constructed by the GetResults.pl Perl program.  Here is a list of the files we construct and later process:

* \<yearToProcess\>PacMastersOWPlacesForEachSwimmer.csv - Open Water results.
* PACRecordsLCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - PAC LCM records.
* PACRecordsSCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - PAC SCM records.
* PACRecordsSCY-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - PAC SCY records.
* PACTop10LCM-\<yearToProcess\>.xlsx - PAC top 10 swimmers for each event, gender, and age group for LCM.
* PACTop10SCM-\<yearToProcess\>.xlsx - PAC top 10 swimmers for each event, gender, and age group for SCM.
* PACTop10SCY-\<yearToProcess\>.xlsx - PAC top 10 swimmers for each event, gender, and age group for SCY..xlsx
* USMSRecords-M-LCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - Men's USMS LCM records.  NOT LMSC specific.
* USMSRecords-M-SCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - Men's USMS SCM records.  NOT LMSC specific.
* USMSRecords-M-SCY-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - Men's USMS SCY records.  NOT LMSC specific.
* USMSRecords-W-LCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - Women's USMS LCM records.  NOT LMSC specific.
* USMSRecords-W-SCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - Women's USMS SCM records.  NOT LMSC specific.
* USMSRecords-W-SCY-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - Women's USMS SCY records.  NOT LMSC specific.
* USMSTop10LCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - USMS top 10 swimmers for each event, gender, and age group for LCM.  Specific to our LMSC.
* USMSTop10SCM-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - USMS top 10 swimmers for each event, gender, and age group for SCM.  Specific to our LMSC.
* USMSTop10SCY-\<yearToProcess\>.csv - USMS top 10 swimmers for each event, gender, and age group for SCY.  Specific to our LMSC.
* races.txt - a list of all meets seen while searching for results to be processed.  This information is used to supply drill-down data for individual swims.


Note:  not all files exists at all times.  For example, at the beginning of a AGSOTY <a href="#seasons">season</a> we won't have any files to process because no meets for the season have been swum.  After a few months there may be results for SCY only, thus no results for SCM and LCM will exist.


<a name="Support"></a>
##### Support/
The Support/ subdirectory contains files accessed at runtime by the HTML files generated by this program.  These files are NOT generated by PMSTopTen, but instead are created and made available to the HTML code.  For example, there is at least one CSS include file, at least one javascript library, some .gif and .jpg files, etc.  Notice that PMSTopTen depends on jquery, and the jquery support files are actually installed in the Support/ directory.  This allows the generated HTML files to operate without internet access (useful during development), and also isolates PMSTopTen from changes to the jquery library that may break the AGSOTY HTML files.

It is a maintenance task to guarantee that an adequate version of all the Support/ files are available to the generated HTML files when they are pushed to production.  See <a href="#maintenanceTasks">"Maintenance Tasks"</a> below.

<a name="rsidn"></a>
##### RSIDN
A "RSIDN" file ("Registered Swimmer IDentification Number") is a file that is used to allow PMSTopTen to identify a Pacific Masters swimmer, both by name and by USMS registration number (which contains the USMS Swimmer Id.)  Every USMS swimmer has a unique Swimmer Id.  However, not every USMS swimmer has a unique name.  This causes some problems when PMSTopTen finds a result identified only by the name of the swimmer, because we may not be able to guarantee that the swimmer is a registered PAC swimmer.  A review of the code will reveal how we handle such situations.

A RSIDN file contains the swimmer's name, USMS registration number, team, etc.

<a name="Vsupport"></a>
##### HTMLVSupport-CAG
A design decision make very early on was that PMSTopTen must be scalable to support Pacific Masters when it has 10,000 competitive swimmers.  If the AGSOTY HTML page was generated with information for all PAC competitive swimmers and there were 10,000 such swimmers the page would take minutes to load (using internet speeds typical in 2016.)  So to get around this, the AGSOTY HTML file (index.html - see above) contains information for only the top 10 swimmers in each gender and age group.  To view more swimmers in a specific gender/age group all one has to do is click on any one of the visible swimmers in that group, or click the "Click here to see the rest of the swimmers" link at the end of the group.  When the user performs either of those actions PMSTopTen will perform an Ajax operation to fetch the rest of the data for that gender/age group.  The "rest of the data" for every gender/age group is stored as individual files in the HTMLVSupport-CAG/ subdirectory of the GeneratedFiles/ directory.




<a name="seasons"></a>
### What is a Season?

When we use the term "season" we may need to qualify the term.  As we all know, USMS competes in three different size pools.  We call each size pool a specific "course".  The three courses USMS uses for competition are:

* Short Course Yards (SCY) - 25 yard length pools.
* Short Course Meters (SCM) - 25 meter length pools.
* Long Course Meters (LCM) - 50 meter length pools.

Each course has a different competitive season, and each of the seasons is 12 months in length.  An AGSOTY season is 19 months in length and encompasses a full season for each course.  This means that the seasons for each course partially overlap.  The seasons for each course are:

* June 1 through May 31 of the following year:  SCY
* October 1 through September 30 of the following year:  LCM
* January 1 through December 31 of the same year:  SCM

Here is a pictorial representation of a single AGSOTY season:

![Swim Seasons](SeasonsOnCalendar.jpg)

In the above example, the 2017 AGSOTY season begins on June 1st, 2016 and ends on December 31, 2017.  This definition of "seasons" clearly defines which swims for a specific course count towards which AGSOTY season.  For example:

> Points earned during a SCY swim on July 4th, 2016 apply towards the 2017 AGSOTY season, but points earned during a SCM swim on the same day apply towards the 2016 AGSOTY season.

For obvious reasons, every swim recorded by USMS must also include the exact course and date of the swim in order for us to compute AGSOTY points correctly.

<a name="TTStats"></a>
### What is TTStats Anyway?
Above we describe a program named "TTStats.pl" which is "used to generate some statistics".  What does that mean?

When Topten2.pl executes it populates a MySql database with a few tables full of data describing every swimmer, event, and splash relevant to computing AGSOTY.  When finished the TTStats.pl program is invoked to use those data to create a simple text file (strictly speaking it's a HTML file but it uses almost no HTML formatting) that can be displayed if desired (see <a href="easter">"Easter Egg"</a> below.)  The data displayed are things like (not a complete list):

* Number of swimmers who swam in exactly one age group (with and without points) by gender
* Number of splashes per age group and gender
* Number of total points earned
* Number of Open Water splashes
* etc.

This information may be interesting for back-end analysis.

BUT, there is another more important purpose for these data.  Three datums are:

* Number of total points earned
* Number of Open Water splashes
* Number of swimmers who swam at least one Open Water event

All three are simple scalars, and are chosen to likely increase or stay constant as the AGSOTY season progresses.  This allows us to easily compare these three values generated during a specific generation of AGSOTY with their counterparts from the previous generation of AGSOTY and confirm that the later statistics are "sane".  For example:

* On Monday the FetchTopten script is executed, followed by the GenTopten2 script, which completes by executing TTStats.pl.  The result is:
    * The "Number of total points earned" is 10,209.
    * The "Number of Open Water splashes" is 523.
    * The "Number of swimmers who swam at least one Open Water event is 523.
* On Tuesday the same scripts are executed.  New results were found so the numbers change:
    * The "Number of total points earned" is 10,498.
    * The "Number of Open Water splashes" is 904.
    * The "Number of swimmers who swam at least one Open Water event is 655.

> The comparison of the statistics generated on Monday with those generated on Tuesday passes the internal sanity test, allowing PMSTopTen to push the AGSOTY files generated on Tuesday to production, overwriting those generated on Monday.  But consider this:

* On Wednesday the same scripts are executed.  New results were found and the numbers change again:
    * The "Number of total points earned" is 504.
    * The "Number of Open Water splashes" is 0.
    * The "Number of swimmers who swam at least one Open Water event is 0.

> The comparison of the statistics generated on Tuesday with those generated on Wednesday tell us that something is wrong.  As a result, the AGSOTY files generated on Wednesday are NOT pushed to production, and instead an email is sent to the maintenance group requiring human intervention before new AGSOTY files are pushed to production.  In all likelihood the maintenance group will review the log files, discover a problem, fix it, and re-run the scripts.




<a name="maintenanceTasks"></a>
## Maintenance Tasks
Here is a list of tasks performed by or on behalf of the PMSTopTen project.  Some are automated, others are manual.  Both are clearly marked as such.

1.  (Automated) Twice a day the cron job runs that will fetch new results (if any), and if there are any new results, this job will compute a new AGSOTY page and push it to the production server.
2. (Manual) January 1 (or slightly after):  Confirm the "Laura Val Swimmer of the Year Awards" page (<https://pacificmasters.org/content/laura-val-swimmer-year-awards> at the time of this writing) points to the AGSOTY page for the current season (aka the new season) and the old season.
2.  (Manual) The first Monday following March 1 of the current year:  The final AGSOTY standings for the old season will be computed on this day (or soon thereafter, depending on the availability of the person managing AGSOTY standings.)  Deliver AGSOTY spreadsheets to the Laura Val Swimmer of the Year Committee.  The spreadsheets include:
	* FullExcelResults-\<old season\>.xlsx
		- Full results showing all CAT 1 competing swimmers.  This spreadsheet basically has the same data as https://pacificmasters.org/points/standings-\<old season\>/ , but as a spreadsheet in case you want to manipulate the data.  It also tells you the top 5 point earners for each gender.

	* Top\_3_ExcelResults\-\<old season>.xlsx
		- Shows the top 3 CAT 1 swimmers for each gender and age group.  Note that this sheet only shows swimmers who meet all necessary criteria for top 3 AGSOTY, e.g. only those swimmers who swam in at least 3 PAC sanctioned pool meets, etc.

	* TopSOTYContenders-\<old season>.xlsx
		- The top 'N' (e.g. 10) CAT 1 male and female swimmers.  This spreadsheet shows you the top 10 male and female swimmers, by points.  We can change ’10’ to anything you want, but 10 is probably enough.  There are other interesting data on this sheet not found anywhere else, like the approximate number of people competing in each swimmer’s age group and number of various 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place swims.  If you want other data let me know.


	Each of the above spreadsheets can be fetched via an http request to the same server that hosts the AGSOTY page, e.g. 
<https://pacificmasters.org/points/standings-2018/TopSOTYContenders-2018.xlsx>

3.  (Manual) After the final AGSOTY standings are computed for the old season (after the first Monday following March 1 - see above) the old season is archived and moved into the Historical area.  See "Move an Old Season into Historical" below.
4. (Manual) When a new season begins (June 1, or soon thereafter) begin the new season.  See "Begin a New Season" below.

<a name="BeginSeason"></a>
### Begin a New Season
A new season begins with the start of the SCY season, which is on June 1 of each year.  Note that just because a new season begins on June 1, the previous season is NOT over.  The AGSOTY season includes the seasons for each course and  span 16 calendar months (see ["What is a Season"](#seasons) above.) In order to begin a new season follow these steps on the "Master" development machine, and then sync all other development machines (if any) to the master repository. This task is performed anytime after June 1 of the new season.

*	On the development machine we need to create a new season-specific Web destination directory:  

	If necessary, create the standings-<new season> in the web tree:  
	
		cd /usr/home/pacdev/public_html/pacmdev.org/sites/default/files/comp/points/
		mkdir standings-<new season>
	Add a link in the  the standings-<new season> directory to the Support directory:
	
		cd standings-<new season>
		ln -s ../Support
		
	At  this point the dev web server  is ready to serve the <new season> AGSOTY points once the AGSOTY files are generated.

*	On the development machine we need to create our new season-specific Source directory:  

		cd <appRootDir>/SeasonData
		Copy the latest Season-<old season> directory
		Paste to "Season-<new season>"
			(at this point we have at least two Season directories:  Season-<old season> and 
			Season-<new season>.  For example, Season-2016/ and Season-2017/)
		cd to "Season-<new season>"
		remove SourceData-<old season>  (remember, this is still in the 
			Season-<old season> directory)
		create the SourceData-<new season> directory
		cd PMSSwimmerData
		remove all old RSIDN files and get a new one (or use an old one for now)
			Same idea for the Club data file and the Merged Members file.  Note that those
			files are optional but you should probably get them if you don't have them.
		cd ..   (cwd=Season-<new season>)
		rename the "properties-<old season>.txt" to "properties-<new season>.txt"
		rename the "properties_DB-<old season>.txt" to "properties_DB-<new season>.txt"
		edit "properties-<new season>.txt" and make necessary changes, e.g.:
			- comment line with name of file
			- Copyright year
			- almost everything else is parameterized with the year by using "{YearBeingProcessed}"
				so you don't have to change those.
		edit "properties_DB-<new season>.txt" and make necessary changes, e.g.:
			(Some installations will require a different
			MySQL user name and/or password for each new database.  In addition, some 
			installations will not allow a simple database name like "TopTen_2017" so the
			below "Initialize our database" instructions will have to be modified, requiring 
			a modification of the 'properties_DB-{new season}.txt' property file.)
			- change the name of the new season's database (dbName - 
				see "Initialize our Database" below.)
			- change the Username and password of the MySQL user for this new database (if 
				necessary)


#### Initialize our Database
On a MAC: this is platform-dependent, so you may have to adjust depending on your
installation.  These instructions assume a simple MySQL platform on a MAC.)

	mysql -u root -p<MySql root password>   
	- CREATE DATABASE TopTen_<new season>;  # (DB name may be platform-dependent)
	- GRANT ALL ON TopTen_<new season>.* TO DBTopTen IDENTIFIED BY 'TopTen';
		(grant all privileges on db (all tables) to Username identified by password.
		Note that Username and password may be platform-dependent)
	- quit

On the dev linux machine use pair.com:

	- Using your browser go to pair.com and ACC log in.
	- Using the left nav menu select 'Databases > Create a New Database'
	- On the 'Add a MySQL Database' page complete the name for  the new database.
		Usually the name is something like 'pacdev_TT2021' where 'pacdev_' is the 
		default prefix, and 'TT2021' uses the <new season> in place of the '2021'.
		- Set 'Access Level' to 'Local/Remote'
		- Leave 'Optimization Period' as 'Monthly'
	- Click "Add Database" and keep the results handy.

### Move an Old Season into Historical
An "old season" is officially over after the first Monday in March of the following year.  (For example, the 2019 season is officially over after March 2nd, 2020.). Once a season is over we archive it this way:

## Generate a Complete AGSOTY Result
The full generation of AGSOTY includes various HTML file, Excel file, log files, etc.  This is covered above.  Since the the AGSOTY files are generated automatically (at the time of this writing, up to twice a day, 7 days a week) AGSOTY generation doesn't usually require human intervention.  But there are exceptions:  

1. Testing.  
2. cron is off.  
3. Results have been posted and an immediate AGSOTY update is requested.  
4. The automatic download of results fails to see any changes.  
4. An end-of-season generation is required.  

Manually generation of AGSOTY can force generation of new files, even if there doesn't appear to be any changes to the results.  For this reason, the final AGSOTY results for a season are always generated manually.  Here are the steps to perform a manual generation of AGSOTY:  

First, you'll need to get sh access on the PMS dev server:  
>`ssh ssh -l pacdev pacdev.pairserver.com`  
`(supply the correct password)`  

We are logged in. Initialize our session to use bash and some custom commands:  
>`bash`  
`cd Automation`  
`. bup/initbash`    # initialize bash for our use

Change directory to the appRootDir and then build a new AGSOTY page  
>`cd PMSTopTen`  
`DoTopten <season to process> y`    # this is a bash function declared by initbash above

It is suggested that you first push the results to the dev server, allowing you to look at all the generated files with your web browser.  Here is how you do that:  
>`Code/Scripts/PMSScripts/PushTT2Dev.bash <season to process>`  

To view what you just pushed use your browser to go here (for example, this is for 2020):  
><https://pacmdev.org/points/standings-2020/index.html>  

If all looks good then push the result to the production server.  This will include the generated Excel files
>`Code/Scripts/PMSScripts/PushTT.bash <season to process>`  

Once you confirm that all looks good (don't forget to review the logs!) send an email to interested people (if any) telling them where they can find/download files of interest.

## Our Easter Egg
In order to allow the maintenance group to easily analyze the results of PMSTopTen the generated AGSOTY HTML file has a hidden [easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)).  To view this easter egg perform the following steps:

1. Open index.html in a browser and then scroll down to the bottom of the file.  At the bottom is a Pacific Masters Swimming logo.  Clicking on the logo will send the user to the Pacific Masters Swimming web site, so don't bother clicking on it.  Instead...
2. Hold down two keys and click on the logo.  The two keys are:
  3. On a Mac:  shift-option
  4. On Windows:  shift-alt
5. The response will be a simple dialog asking "Show Details?".  Click "OK" to get your prize.

What you will then see is a display of the top overall swimmers (by points) and a list of all events analyzed to award points to PAC swimmers.  In addition, at the bottom of this new display is a button titled "Show Statistics".  Click that and you'll see the TTStats generated as a result of this AGSOTY generation. 
####Note added 1Mar2020:
To allow access to the easter egg on a phone/tablet (basically, any device without a keyboard) you can also scroll down to the end of the page, past the Pacific Masters Swimming logo, where you will see the time and date of page generation. Hover your cursor on the space following the closing ')' and your cursor should change into a selection cursor.  Click and reply to the dialog.
