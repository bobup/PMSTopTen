GIT-TTPoints:
This are just some random notes used to write an eventual document

*** Definitions:
	- rootDir:  the parent of our various appRootDir's.  The appRootDirs are:
		PMSOWPoints - manage PMS open water points
		PMSTopTen - manage PMS AGSOTY (that's what this writeup is concentrating on)
		PMSPerlModules - helper Perl modules used by the two above projects.
	- appRootDir: the PMSTopTen directory, the parent of which is rootDir
	
*** Begin a new season:
	- Create our new season-specific Source directory:
		% cd <appRootDir>/Code/working/
		- Copy the latest SourceData
		- Paste to "SourceData-<new season>"
		- cd to "SourceData-<new season>"
		- remove all the previous year's result files; "races.txt"
		- remove all old RSIDN files and get a new one (or use an old one for now)
		- rename the "properties-<old season>" to "properties-<new season>"
		- edit "properties-<new season>" and make necessary changes:
			- comment line with name of file
			- RSIDNFileName
			- PMSOpenWaterResultFile
	- Initialize our database:
		- mysql -u root -p1994Maggie
			- CREATE DATABASE TopTen_<new season>;
			- GRANT ALL ON TopTen_<new season>.* TO DBTopTen IDENTIFIED BY 'TopTen';
				(grant all privileges on db (all tables) to Username identified by password)
	- use GetResults.pl to make sure we get the expected results in 
		the SourceData-<new season> and Generated-<new season> directories:
		- from Eclipse:  change the properties.txt file to contain the <new season>, or
		- from Terminal: FetchTopten <new season>
	- Add a link to the Support directory to the Generated-<new season> directory:
		- copy the Support directory alias from Generated-<old season> 
			to Generated-<new season>
	- use Topten2.pl to process the fetched files and make sure we get the expected results
		in the Generated-<new season> directory:
		- from Eclipse:  change the properties.txt file to contain the <new season>, or
		- from Terminal: GenTopten <new season>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	- Remove all the files in the GeneratedFiles directory EXCEPT the Support symbolic link.
	- Remove all the files and sub-directories in the OWResults directory.  This is where 
		the new year's results will be placed.
	- Edit the "properties.txt" file to include the <new year>-properties.txt instead
		of the <previous year>-properties.txt
	- Refresh your Eclipse project.


****** Create a local repository from the PMSTopTen remote repository

# First, we must have the latest PMSPerlModules.  Get them here:
% cd $rootDir			# see Definition of 'rootDir'.  Create if necessary
% git clone https://github.com/bobup/PMSPerlModules

# Next, we get the latest PMSTopTen files:
% git clone https://github.com/bobup/PMSTopTen

# At this point we have the source code but no "Generated Files", so we'll have 
# to generate some.  In the 'SeasonData' directory there should be one or more 
# source directories named "Season-yyyy' where 'yyyy' is some year.  Here's how we'll
# generate some results assuming we have data for 2017.  Plug in whatever year for which
# you have data.
# First, set up your MySql server.  You need to install MySql and create a root account
# with all permissions.  Then do the following (you may have to change names/passwords
# to match the code - see the call to PMS_MySqlSupport::SetSqlParameters() in the file
# PMSTopTen/Code/Topten2.pl to see what the code uses.)
% mysql -u root -p
<supply root password for your MySql server>
> show databases;
# if you have a database named "TopTen_2017" (where '2017' is the year in this example)
# then you're done.  Or you can drop it like this:
> DROP DATABASE TopTen_2017;
# to create the database do this:
> CREATE DATABASE TopTen_2017;
> GRANT ALL ON TopTen_2017.* TO DBTopTen IDENTIFIED BY 'TopTen';
> exit

# Now we're ready to process the source data that we got from Git and create the
# various result files:
% cd PMSTopTen		# Remember: you are now in $rootDir/PMSTopTen
# You may want to change the 'EMAIL_NOTICE' variable in the GenTopten2 script used
# next so it will send an email to the correct person.  Then execute the script:
% Code/Scripts/GenTopten2 2017
