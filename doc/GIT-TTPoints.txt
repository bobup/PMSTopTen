GIT-TTPoints:
This are just some random notes used to write an eventual document

*** Definitions:
	- appRootDir: the PMSTopTen directory
	
*** Begin a new season:
	- Create our new season-specific Source directory:
		% cd <appRootDir>/Code/working/
		- Copy the latest SourceData
		- Paste to "SourceData-<new season>"
		- cd to "SourceData-<new season>"
		- remove all the previous year's result files; "races.txt"
		- remove all old RSIDN files and get a new one (or use an old one for now)
		- rename the "properties-<old season>" to "properties-<new season>"
		- edit "properties-<new season>" and make necessary changes:
			- comment line with name of file
			- RSIDNFileName
			- PMSOpenWaterResultFile
	- Initialize our database:
		- mysql -u root -p1994Maggie
			- CREATE DATABASE TopTen_<new season>;
			- GRANT ALL ON TopTen_<new season>.* TO DBTopTen IDENTIFIED BY 'TopTen';
				(grant all privileges on db (all tables) to Username identified by password)
	- use GetResults.pl to make sure we get the expected results in 
		the SourceData-<new season> and Generated-<new season> directories:
		- from Eclipse:  change the properties.txt file to contain the <new season>, or
		- from Terminal: FetchTopten <new season>
	- Add a link to the Support directory to the Generated-<new season> directory:
		- copy the Support directory alias from Generated-<old season> 
			to Generated-<new season>
	- use Topten2.pl to process the fetched files and make sure we get the expected results
		in the Generated-<new season> directory:
		- from Eclipse:  change the properties.txt file to contain the <new season>, or
		- from Terminal: GenTopten <new season>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	- Remove all the files in the GeneratedFiles directory EXCEPT the Support symbolic link.
	- Remove all the files and sub-directories in the OWResults directory.  This is where 
		the new year's results will be placed.
	- Edit the "properties.txt" file to include the <new year>-properties.txt instead
		of the <previous year>-properties.txt
	- Refresh your Eclipse project.
